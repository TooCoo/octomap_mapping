## Notes Notes Notes

Just forked this, and looking through it.

I want to change some things, to allow for semantic labels and mean colors to be stored for each voxel.

## Things I'm seeing that I should remember...

Sensor models can be set. things can be filtered.

I can use colored maps.

# TODO
- check colored map flag in octomap.
